# Pixelbot
A basic discord chatbot created using discord.py. The bot has a few basic features, but I plan to add onto it soon. To use this code for your own bot, create a file called botKey.py, and make a string variable called botKey that contains your botKey. Please contact me if reusing code.

## Features
 - Magic 8 ball
 - Flip a coin
## Moderation features
 - Ban users
 - Kick users
 - Unban users
